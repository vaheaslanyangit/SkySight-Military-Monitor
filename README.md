## Model Capabilities

Our YOLOv5 model has been meticulously fine-tuned using a dataset of 300 images, featuring 100 images for each class. The images encompass various environments, angles, and lighting conditions, captured at noon with clear skies using a UAV at approximately 100 meters altitude. 

The model proficiently identifies the following classes with high accuracy and speed:

- Main Battle Tank
- Infantry Fighting Vehicle
- Transport Truck
